            <div class="project">
                <h3>Stone vs Lava</h3>
                <p>Participated in my first game jam, focusing on understanding and adapting to time constraints in rapid game development. Designed and implemented physics-based gameplay mechanics inspired by titles like Angry Birds and Whirly Bird. Gained experience in iterative prototyping, feature prioritization, and delivering a functional, polished gameplay loop within a limited timeframe.</p>

                <h3>A Cube</h3>
                <p>Developed my first 3D game featuring a self-built physics system inspired by Edge. Focused on understanding and implementing physics principles, collision handling, and time complexity within a 3D environment. Experimented with custom movement logic and physics calculations to achieve smooth, responsive gameplay and a unique control feel.</p>

                <h3>Bwoom!!</h3>
                <p>Designed and implemented a unique approach to player input and movement systems, exploring alternative control schemes to enhance player engagement. Focused on analyzing which movement mechanics feel intuitive and appealing versus those that donâ€™t. Concept and implementation fully based on my own original idea, emphasizing experimentation and player experience refinement.</p>
